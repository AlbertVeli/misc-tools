Random collection of misc tools

* ccoincidences: Xor a file against itself and count coincidences.
                 If the file is xor "encrypted" the length of the
		 key used will reveal itself.
* entropy: Calculate entropy (bits/byte, max 8) for a file
* isprime: Checks if an integer is prime or not (needs libgmp)
* outbin: Reads a file containing hex code and prints its binary representation
* reverse: Reverse all bytes in file (print result to stdout)
* subnet_calculator: Calculate ipv4 subnet range
