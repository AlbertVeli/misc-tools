DESCRIPTION

This is a python script I wrote during the BackdoorCTF15 competition
on April 2 2015 to solve the rapid fire challenge.

Before running it you need to create the titleyear.py file in the
datasources directory.

cd datasources
./list2python.sh > titleyear.py

That downloads the latest imdb list of titles and uses some sed magic
(aka sedmagheddon) to create the python code.

You also need the files piM.txt and primesM.txt which can be found in
the following zipfile:

https://minfil.org/Lakaidbab4/pi_primes.7z

Just get it and unpack it inside the datasources directory.


SIMULATE SERVER

The run_server.sh script contains some magic to run script.sh
redirecting stdin/stdout to a service at tcp port 6666 with a little
help from a named pipe and netcat. If you want you can change the port
number and script name to run some script you write yourself at some
port at your liking.

Script.sh contains some hardcoded questions similar to the ones at the
real challenge. It's main use is to test if rapidfire.py works before
launching it against the real server.


RUN CLIENT

This is the main code, rapidfire.py. Default it is set to run against
the simulated local server. You can change one line inside the script
to run it against the real server. After testing that everything
works, change 'nc localhost 6666' to 'nc hack.bckdr.in 8008'.


TODO

Movie release years is shaky. Often misses because it doesn't include
aka titles. Fix this.
